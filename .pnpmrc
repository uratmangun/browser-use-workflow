# Disable optional dependencies to prevent build failures on Vercel
# This prevents packages like 'lzo' from being installed, which require
# native compilation and can fail due to missing system dependencies
optional=false

# Alternative: you can also disable specific optional dependencies
# by using the following syntax (commented out):
# optional-deps.lzo=false
