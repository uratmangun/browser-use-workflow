# Disable optional dependencies to avoid build failures on Vercel
# This prevents the lzo package (optional dependency of parquetjs) from being installed
# lzo requires native compilation which fails due to missing distutils in Python 3.12+
optional=false

# Alternative approach: if you need other optional dependencies,
# consider using pnpm.overrides in package.json instead
